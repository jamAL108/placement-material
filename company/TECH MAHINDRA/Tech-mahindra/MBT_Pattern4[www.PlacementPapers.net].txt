Subject: [CHETANA] (info) about MBT

hi
regarding int. pattern,,,
HR is as usual,,,
Regarding technical int,,,
they ask question from C,c++,java(basic java), OS (tanenbum fundas & unix internals), Computer networks, DBMS (normalization and other fundas and some part relateed to SQL), and data structre and algorithms...(sorting searching, treemlink list etc).. u should also expect quest. from yr final semeser project...
 
nowadays MOST companies r ALSO asking software engineering and system development life ccycle related fundas, but i don't know whehter mbt ppl r asking such quest. or not...
 
now, my query to to ppl who r getting int. calls from mbt... i also appeared in walkin at pune on 19th ,, and attempted 30 quest. out of 68 with very high accurcy( as i have also gave CAT last year) ...can anybody give me idea @ my chances for getting int. call.. i have not receive any mail from mbt. mbt have tell us tht, selected ppl will be informed within 10 days for interview call....

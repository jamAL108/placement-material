Daer vijay, 

The test was for about 40 mints. I wrote the test in one of MBT's consultant. So i guess it gonna be diff at MBT. 

There were 20 C++ Q. I dont remeber them as i am not proficient in C++. But it comprises of only basic knowledge in C++ from Virtual Fn, Inheritance etc. Question were asked to give the O/P of a given code segment. There were 5 Unix Q too. 

it was... 

1. How can a process be started automatically in UNIX ? 

ANS : Through CRONTAB { options were crontab, inittab, and two more } 

2. What is the meaning of run level 6 ? 

ANS. Reboot 

3. How can you determine which file has generated the CORE ? 

Options were.. 

1.ps -ef | grep core 

2.ps -ef | grep <executable file name > 

3.pfile core 

4.filec core 

Options 1 or 2 may be correct i am not sure. 

Regards , 

Niranjan
